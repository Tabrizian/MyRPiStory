# My RPi Story
## Get Started!
### First step, Install raspbian!
The first step was installing the raspbian linux on it. It was hard for me because my SD card was corrupted. Be sure that your SD card has no problem. To install raspian on it visit [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/).

### Some sample projects
1. Run a Web Server on Your RPi.  
First step is installing apache and php and mysql on your RPi. For doing so
just run ``` sudo apt-get install apache2 & mysql & php ```.
Second step make the IP of your RPi static. If you have internet access you
can easily host your projects on rpi and offer them to the world.
